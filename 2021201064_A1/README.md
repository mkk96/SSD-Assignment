Q4. Script can expected any number of argument if number of input argument is 1 and 2 this program will give some meaningfull result.
	number of argument is one and its integer then program check wether number is in range of 1-3999 if yes then print corresponding roman number
	number of argument is one and its valid roman then program convert into integer
	number of argument is two and both are integer then program sum them and check the number lie between 1 and 3999 if yest then it print corresponding roman number.
	number of argument is two and both are valid roman number then program convert them into integer and diplay the sum on screen.
	#Error msges and assumption
	converting single roman value to integer if number of input argument is one
	if number of argument is less than 1 and greater than 2 then printing error msges
	if number of arugment is 1 and that is not valid integer or roman then printing error msge
